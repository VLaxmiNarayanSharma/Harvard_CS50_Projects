#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/OQnh_oP8w3Q?si=U4899t-0pDYH9Ig6
#### Description:
My Project is an Email Server which can work as a private mail server for anyone using this email server we can send and
receive mail from anyother email accounts.It has first a register and login page if we have already registered than we
can login using our previous mail account and if we are new and first time coming to this we have to regiseter by
creating an account and password we need to register ourselves. If confirmation password does not match with our password
 than it's going to show passwords do not match.It's crucial to remember password after registering ourselves in email.

After loging inside mail we will be shown inbox which will display all mails we have received from other emails,than we
 can write or compose our own mails using compose module present beside the inbox here we have our mail automatically
 displayed as sender ,than we have to write recipient email in to box and we have to fill the subject space given to
 specify main intention of writing that mailso that receiver will have an overview of why we have sent the mail.Writing
subject box is very important and crucial as it will give insight to receiver if the mail is very important and valid
After writing the subject tab we have body tab where we can write our main message to the receiver.We can fill very large
message also inside the body tab so that recipient will have an detailed idea on our message and what we want to convey
to the recipient.We must also be careful in writing the recipient email id properly to send it otherwise we may send mail
to wrong person.

Beside the compose module is the sent module, where we can see all the mails we have send to other email accounts.In this
module first we will be displayed our email account id through which we have sent the mail with sender heading tag, Than
we are hown the main subject we have used to send that mail to recipient we are also shown the date of sending the mail
in format YYYY-MM-DD with timing also which is created using timestamp.The project has 2 database directory which are
users and emails which keep account of all the mail and account we have used in the emailserver. It's important to keep
history of all the mails we have used in this project,hence it's important to automatically update database.So this
project is an enhancement over the remaining emailserver.This is very important to use such innovative and creative email
 server.
